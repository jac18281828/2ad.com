In 2018, Dr. Cairns joined [Thrive Pet Healthcare](https://www.thrivepetcare.com/) in a senior medical leadership role and later served five years as Vice President of Medical Excellence & Education for nearly 400 veterinary hospitals nationwide. She built the Medical Excellence & Education department from the ground up, designing large-scale programs, clinical quality systems, education platforms and leadership development initiatives that improved veterinary medical care and strengthened teams across a national network.

Today, Dr. Cairns is an adjunct faculty member at the [Lincoln Memorial University College of Veterinary Medicine](https://www.lmunet.edu/college-of-veterinary-medicine), where she contributes to veterinary curriculum design, clinical reasoning education and modern teaching models such as team-based learning and competency-based veterinary education (CBVE).

She is frequently sought after by veterinary organizations and media outlets for expert commentary on internal medicine, veterinary education, clinical reasoning, leadership, team culture and professional wellbeing.

Her work brings together clinical excellence, medical strategy, education innovation and leadership development to support high-quality veterinary care and sustainable veterinary careers. She is passionate about helping veterinarians, students and organizations grow with confidence, purpose and long-term wellbeing.

Dr. Cairns lives in Naperville, Illinois, with her family, including a very loved (and very poorly mannered) Labrapittie mix. Outside of her professional roles, she enjoys distance running and the science of brewing the perfect cup of tea.
