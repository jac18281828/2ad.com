Dr. Kelly Cairns graduated veterinary school from CSU in 2004, completed a small animal rotating internship at Cornell in 2005 and completed a small animal internal medicine residency at the Ohio State University in 2008, at which time she obtained Diplomate status. She enjoyed a rewarding clinical practice as an internist and medical director of a multi-specialty/ER hospital until joining Pathway Vet Alliance in January of 2018 (currently known as Thrive Pet Healthcare).

Dr. Cairns currently serves as Vice President of Medical Excellence and Education for the 400+ hospitals in the [Thrive Pet Healthcare](https://www.thrivepetcare.com) family.  She is also an adjunct faculty member at [Lincoln Memorial University College of Veterinary Medicine](https://www.lmunet.edu/college-of-veterinary-medicine/index), a [Chicago Veterinary Medical Association](https://www.chicagovma.org) Board of Directors member and a [dvm360](https://dvm360.com) editorial board member. She lectures internationally on profession-related wellness and leadership coaching topics, veterinary education models and internal medicine.  She is passionate about supporting the growth, success, and happiness of the superheroes in our amazing profession. 

She lives in Naperville with her three children, husband, cat and very sweet but poorly mannered Labrapittie mix! When not engaged with her Thrive family or corralling her personal family, she enjoys personal fitness/running and the science of home brewing the perfect cup of coffee.
