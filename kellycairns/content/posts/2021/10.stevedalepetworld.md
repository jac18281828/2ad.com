Listen to a wide-ranging conversation with Dr. Kelly Cairns from [Steve Dale’s Pet World](https://stevedalepetworld.com/blog/communicating-with-pet-parents-pets-feel-stress-at-the-holidays-just-like-you-do/) on [WGN Radio](https://wgnradio.com/steve-dales-pet-world/steve-dales-pet-world-12-12-2021-what-to-do-when-pets-get-anxious-around-the-holidays-tips-to-keep-pets-safe-at-christmas-and-more/), vice president of Medical Excellence and Education at Thrive Pet Healthcare; she is based in Naperville. Dr. Cairns has just given the keynote address at the FETCH Veterinary Conference, San Diego, CA. Dr. Cairns talks about how veterinary medicine has changed during the pandemic, and how the use of telehealth is here to stay. Also, how everyone is feeling totally stressed, clients and veterinary processionals. Her advice isn’t only excellent for how you regard your veterinarian but perhaps also for life: “Assume best intentions. And we realize we’re all in this together.”
