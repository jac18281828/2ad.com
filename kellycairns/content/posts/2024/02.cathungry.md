Dr. Kelly Cairns joins Rita and Linda to talk about cats and appetite. Some common questions we hear from cat parents, and we sometimes ask ourselves:  Why is my cat hungry all the time?  My cat seems hungry but refuses his food, why?  Am I feeding my cat too much? Too litter?  Is what I am feeding the best and right food for him?  Dr. Kelly is here to talk about all that, what may cause a cat to not eat or to overeat, and when it’s time to take your cat to the vet to find out what’s going on.
