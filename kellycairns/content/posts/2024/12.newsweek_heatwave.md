As temperatures soar across California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas, it's crucial for pet owners to be vigilant about the dangers of heatwaves. Leading veterinarians have issued urgent advice to help you keep your pets safe during these extreme conditions. 

**The Rising Temperatures**

With triple-digit temperatures expected this week, it's not just humans who need to take precautions. Pets are particularly vulnerable to the heat, and it's our responsibility to ensure they stay cool and hydrated. 

**Recognizing Heat-Related Illnesses**

Dr. Whitney Miller, Petcoâ€™s Chief Veterinarian, emphasizes the importance of recognizing signs of overheating and dehydration in pets. Symptoms include panting, drooling, deep or rapid breathing, weakness, disorientation, and vomiting. Heatstroke can severely impact your pet's gastrointestinal system, kidneys, heart, lungs, brain, and hemostatic system, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes regardless of treatment.

**Preventative Measures**

Dr. Kelly Cairns from Thrive Pet Healthcare advises keeping pets indoors with air conditioning and a steady supply of cool drinking water. Limit walks to cooler hours in the morning and late evening. Remember, if the pavement is too hot for your hand, it's too hot for their paws. Always provide access to shade and fresh water if your pet is outdoors, and never leave them unattended in a parked car.

**In Case of Emergency**

If your pet shows signs of heat-related illness, act immediately. Dr. Cairns recommends taking your pet to a veterinarian without delay to prevent severe complications. Pets with underlying health conditions, young and old animals are at a higher risk during hot periods. Cooling measures include offering cool water, wetting the pet with cool water, and running air conditioning. Avoid cold baths as they can trap heat in the body.
