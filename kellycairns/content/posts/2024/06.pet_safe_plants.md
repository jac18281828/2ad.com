If you're a cat owner looking to add some greenery to your home, it's important to choose houseplants that are safe for your feline friend. Many popular plants, such as lilies, hydrangeas, pothos, and sago palms, can be harmful or toxic to cats. However, there are several safe options available, including spider plants, parlor palms, sweetheart plants, and mini orchids.

To make your search easier, online retailers like Lively Root and Easyplant offer curated collections of cat-safe plants. Even with these safer options, Dr. Kelly Cairns from Thrive Pet Healthcare advises limiting your cat’s access to plants as ingesting any plant material can lead to vomiting and diarrhea, especially in large quantities. For further research, the ASPCA provides a comprehensive list of both toxic and non-toxic plants for cats.

Additionally, Forbes Vetted’s pet expert Emmy Favilla has helped compile a list of 15 of the safest plants for cats. Remember to also consult guides on the best indoor plants suitable for various home environments and care levels to ensure you find the perfect fit for both your home and your pet.
