DNA testing has emerged as a valuable tool for dog owners, providing insights into their pet's breed composition and potential health risks. Dr. Kelly Cairns of Thrive Pet Healthcare highlights that these tests can reveal genetic predispositions to various conditions, such as drug sensitivities, degenerative diseases, and liver issues. By understanding a dog's genetic makeup, owners can tailor care plans to address specific health needs and behavioral traits, potentially extending their pet's lifespan. The process is simple: a cheek swab is sent to a lab for analysis, and results can guide more informed veterinary care.
