Dr. Kelly Cairns graduated veterinary school from CSU in 2004, completed a small animal rotating internship at Cornell in 2005 and completed a small animal internal medicine residency at OSU in 2008, at which time she obtained Diplomate status.  She enjoyed a rewarding clinical practice as an internist and medical director of a multi-specialty/ER hospital until joining Pathway Vet Alliance (now [Thrive Pet Healthcare](https://www.thrivepetcare.com/thrive-guide/pathway-vet-alliance-becomes-thrive-pet-healthcare)) in January of 2018.  Dr. Cairns currently serves as Vice President of Medical Excellence and Education for over 400 hospitals in the Thrive Pet Healthcare family.  She is also on the dvm360 editorial board and an active member of the Chicago Veterinary Medical Association.  She lectures nationally on profession-related wellness coaching topics as well as internal medicine.

Dr. Cairns provides coaching and resources to support the medical excellence, professional development and sustained happiness of veterinary healthcare team members.  She is passionate about supporting the people in the veterinary profession on the front line who positively impact the lives of their patients and pet parents every day.


In her personal time Dr. Cairns is an avid runner and enjoys family life with her husband, two daughters, son, two cats and very sweet but poorly mannered lab-dane mix.
