I am running the Chicago Marathon in 2023 as a tribute to all the veterinary professionals who we have lost to suicide. I am also running this race in special honor of Charli (Alex) Rae Lewis, an amazing young human who we lost on September 5th 2021, just before their 16th birthday.  The world lost a bright light that day and I have run for them every day since.   This marathon allows me to run and not only honor those dear to me who I have lost, but also to help the AFSP continue to have resources to support those who need it so their lights may continue to shine.
