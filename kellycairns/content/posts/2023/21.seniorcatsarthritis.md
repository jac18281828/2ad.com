One of the biggest issues for cat parents is getting that yearly wellness check for our felines. Since cats are masters at hiding illness, it’s more important to get them seen each year. Twice a year is recommended for senior cats. Dr. Kelly will tell us why this is so critical to your cat’s overall health and wellness.

Dr. Kelly Cairns, DVM is VP of medical excellence education for over 400 Thrive Pet Healthcare family facilities! She is passionate about health care for all our pets, but she has a special fondness for our feline friends. (We love that!).
