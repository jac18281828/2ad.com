The popularity of tofu has expanded beyond the kitchen to include tofu cat litter, promoted as a water-soluble, flushable, and environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional clay and silica-based litters. As many TikTok users praise this new product, there are concerns about cats mistaking tofu cat litter for food and consuming it.

To address these concerns, experts, including celebrity cat behaviorist Jackson Galaxy, weighed in on the topic. Galaxy stated that various natural cat litters exist, such as those made from corn, wheat, and coconut husks. However, he warns against the possible health risks of cats ingesting clay-based litters, particularly the dangers of sodium bentonite.

Kelly Cairns, DVM, the vice president of medical excellence and education at Thrive Pet Healthcare, notes that cats are usually discerning and unlikely to eat their litter on purpose. While it's rare, cats might ingest small amounts of litter accidentally if it sticks to their fur during grooming. Cairns mentions that this may cause minor stomach issues but is not typically harmful. She adds that cats, especially kittens, are naturally curious and might sample fresh litter out of interest. However, no substantial research suggests that any specific type of cat litter, including tofu-based litter, is harmful when ingested in small quantities. If a cat continually tries to consume the litter, Cairns recommends consulting a veterinarian as it could indicate a more serious condition called pica.
