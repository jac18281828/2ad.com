PINELLAS COUNTY, Fla. — When holding a dog as lovable as Twinkie, things can get slightly sloppy.

Loveless said microchipping is the best way to ensure dogs like Twinkie don’t lose during a hurricane.

“Take your animal to your veterinarian or low-cost clinic and have a microchip implanted right between the shoulder blades. What it does is create an ID in your pet. A safe way for them to be recognized,” she said.
