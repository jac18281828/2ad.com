Letâ€™s talk about Parasite Prevention. Our favorite veterinarian, Dr. Kelly Cairns, is with us to talk about the importance of prevention, even for cats.  What kind of parasites might plague our cats? Fleas, Ticks, Tapeworms, Ringworms, Ear Mites, and also Heartworm. Linda and Rita did not know that cats could indeed get Heartworm, although it is more prevalent in dogs.

Dr. Kelly Cairns, DVM is VP of medical excellence education for over 400 Thrive Pet Healthcare family facilities! She is passionate about health care for all our pets, but she has a special fondness for our feline friends. (We love that!).
