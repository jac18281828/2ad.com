As of Dec. 1 16 cases of respiratory illness have been submitted to Washington State Department of Agriculture. Dog boarding facilities are exercising increased caution due to this mysterious respiratory illness affecting dogs. Highlighted in the KING 5 News article, Dr. Kelly Cairns of Thrive Pet Healthcare emphasizes the importance of dog social distancing, particularly for those exhibiting symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, or nasal discharge. Severe symptoms like a harsh cough, lethargy, or difficulty breathing necessitate urgent veterinary care. The increase in cases may be linked to decreased vaccination rates and altered social behaviors in dogs post-pandemic.
