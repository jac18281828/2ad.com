When a cat presents with jaundiceâ€”evidenced by yellowing of the skin, gums, or scleraâ€”itâ€™s a clinical sign that should never be ignored. In her latest article published on *dvm360*, Dr. Kelly Cairns takes a deep dive into the diagnostic approach and treatment options for icteric cats, outlining how veterinarians can confidently navigate this challenging presentation.

## Breaking Down the Yellow

Icterus, or jaundice, arises from elevated bilirubin levels in the bloodstream and can point to a range of hepatobiliary or systemic diseases. Dr. Cairns offers a clear, step-by-step framework to differentiate between the three primary causes of icterus:

- **Prehepatic** (e.g., hemolysis)
- **Hepatic** (e.g., hepatic lipidosis, cholangitis)
- **Posthepatic** (e.g., bile duct obstruction)

This classification is crucial for prioritizing diagnostic tests and initiating the right treatment protocols.

## Diagnostic Precision

Dr. Cairns emphasizes the value of a thorough history and physical exam, coupled with baseline diagnostics like:

- CBC and chemistry profile
- Coagulation tests
- Imaging (especially ultrasound)
- Fine-needle aspirates or biopsies when appropriate

She also addresses when advanced imaging or bile duct decompression may be warranted.

## Treating the Underlying Cause

Treatment strategies must be tailored to the diagnosis, but Dr. Cairns highlights common supportive measures that are almost universally applicable, including:

- Nutritional supportâ€”often via feeding tubes in anorexic cats
- Hepatoprotectants such as SAMe and silybin
- Fluid therapy and electrolyte correction
- Vitamin K supplementation in coagulopathic patients

Importantly, Dr. Cairns advocates for early and aggressive nutritional support, especially in cases of hepatic lipidosis, to prevent irreversible hepatic damage.

## A Practical, Case-Based Approach

What sets this article apart is its accessible, practical tone. Dr. Cairns doesnâ€™t just present the theoryâ€”she guides veterinarians through how to apply it in real clinical settings, including pearls for managing client expectations and working within different budget levels.

## Final Thoughts

If youâ€™re a veterinary professional who encounters feline patients with jaundice, Dr. Cairnsâ€™ article is a must-read. It delivers clarity in a complex clinical situation, empowering clinicians to make informed, compassionate decisions.
