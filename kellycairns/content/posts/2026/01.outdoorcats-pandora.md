The conversation focuses on one of the most important but often overlooked drivers of feline illness: **stress**. Dr. Cairns explains how environmental stressors can contribute to medical problems, including **Pandora syndrome**, and how early behavior changes can signal that a cat needs help before disease progresses.

Listeners will also get practical ideas for creating safer, lower-stress environments through enrichment, predictable routines, and better support for natural feline behaviors. If you care for indoor cats, outdoor cats, or both, this episode offers useful guidance for balancing safety, quality of life, and long-term wellness.
