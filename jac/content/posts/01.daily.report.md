The new green leaves bristled in the breeze</br>
I was remembering love and the crashing sea</br>
The birds were joyously singing free </br>

In this moment</br>

On the outer banks of the sandy shore</br>
Crumpled shirt and faded pants were all the fashion I may be</br>
Disappearing in one moment and returning</br> 
in another</br>

In this moment</br>

All that is loss; may well be gain </br>
So all our tears to spirit</br>
Buried deep </br>
an unseen treasure</br>
of feeling time</br>

 In this moment</br>
