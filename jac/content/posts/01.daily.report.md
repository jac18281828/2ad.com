 In this moment
 
The new green leaves bristled in the breeze
I was remembering love and the crashing sea
The birds were joyously singing free 

In this moment

On the outer banks of the sandy shore
Crumpled shirt and faded pants were all the fashion I may be
Disappearing in one moment and returning 
in another

In this moment

All that is loss; may well be gain 
So all our tears to spirit
Buried deep 
an unseen treasure
of feeling time

 In this moment
