New and untouched by all the other</br>
Chapters that came before</br>
I have outgrown the old story</br>
Something familiar about this place</br>
Familiar and a little frightening </br>
Thereâ€™s a kind of despair</br>
A sense of possible violence</br>
Yet all under control</br>
The gentle things </br>
The tender things </br>
Sometimes funny things</br>
