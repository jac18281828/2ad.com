I am finding courage to be myself. </br>
Being brave with things not being the same </br>
“don’t wish to be normal. Wish to be yourself. </br>
to the hilt. Find out what you are best at and develop it, and hopscotch your weaknesses.</br>
Wish to be great at whatever you are.”</br>
Koi’s McMaster Bujold</br>

Dreaming of a greener tomorrow!</br>
How did the Covid virus inspire Milan</br>
To clean it’s polluted streets for good.</br>
It wants to not go back to it’s polluted </br>
ways when the city is reopened.</br>

Where children can play in the garden and
create.</br>
