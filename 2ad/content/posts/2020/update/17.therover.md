I'm working on another audio book for [librivox](https://librivox.org).   [*The Rover*](https://librivox.org/the-rover-by-joseph-conrad/) by Joseph Conrad is an excellent book about a former sea captain and pirate. The setting, during the French Revolution, couldn't be more apt and provides wonderful historical context.
