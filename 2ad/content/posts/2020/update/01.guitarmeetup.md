In spring of 2018 I injured my right hand in a bad fall while running.  I stopped playing guitar for 6 months ðŸ˜±.   I was so frustrated to lose progress that the I ended up with "writers block" for almost a year.   I have only recently started playing again.  And I am so happy to be back at it!

Today I attended the [Naperville Acoustic Guitar Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Naperville-Acoustic-Guitar-Meetup/).  This was the longest I have played continuously in a long time.
