If you are using Pi Hole or Unifi Edgerouter for Ad Blocking via a host file, check out [fetch_blocker](https://github.com/jac18281828/fetch_adblocker).   This is a straightforward python script to pull the [Steven Black Hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) consolidated adblocker list and convert it to dnsmasq format.
