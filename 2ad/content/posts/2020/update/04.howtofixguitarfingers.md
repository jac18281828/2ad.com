After injuring my hand I was unable to play guitar for some time.   As a result I lost some of my finger condition and it has been difficult to get it back.  One trick for playing an extended set without the ouchy fingers is to use Gorilla Glue.

A put a drop of "super" glue on a clear cellophane wrap.   I then used my finger to smear it around and allowed it to dry.  This worked better than expected.   I experienced no pain after hours of playing!
