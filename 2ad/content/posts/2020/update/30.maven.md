I'm concerned that [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is wasting
my time.  Why do I have this concern?  When I do a `maven` build of my
entire project the cpus on my system are only half utilized.   I
remember in the past when I used `make -j` it could bring my machine
to its knees and make it unusable.  When compiling a Linux kernel you
would have to walk away for 45 minutes or more.   I would have to
renice `make` to prevent the system from becoming unusable.   But
`maven` is so gentle on the system that I barely know its running.

My suspicion is that many software systems built in the
modern era are so complex and driven by so many different
packages and plugins that its essentially impossible to improve
overall performance.  I believe `maven` falls into this category.  It
might be an example of the emergence of a 'dark age' of software
systems where software is less resilient, exhibits poorer performance
with much greater complexity for no overall improvement.   The worst
part of it is that adoption of these software tools is driven by
socialization and norms rather than potential benefits.  

Don't get me started on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
