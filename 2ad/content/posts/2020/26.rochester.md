I used the remarkable silhouette of Rochester Castle, Kent, UK to create an icon to represent besieged cities in the upcoming Warfare in the Age of Crusades - The Latin East.  Available 2021!   

Rochester Castle is no stranger to siege warfare.   In October 1215 King John besieged it.  The intractable task involved mining underneath to burn the tower with pig fat.   The collapsed wall near the Great Keep remains as it fell to this day.
