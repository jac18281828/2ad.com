Should you enable your efficiency cores for use by Docker on Apple Silicon?

If you enable the efficiency cores there are 2 additional cores for the system scheduler to allocate to your workload.  However, if you leave them disabled, these 2 cores will remain in reserve for use by supportive tasks and the desktop.

Running the full build of the very expensive [Foundry Docker Image](https://github.com/collectivexyz/foundry) with 8 performance cores.  The build runs in 7 munites 35 seconds.

### Foundry tools build (rust) 8 performance cores, 16gb, 32gb m1 max

```

```

In comparison, enabling the 2 additional efficiency cores does not dramatically impact the build time.

It turns out the MacOS scheduler almost immediately promotes intensive workloads to the performance cores. Therefore you should not enable efficiency cores on Apple Silicon for performance intensive workloads.
