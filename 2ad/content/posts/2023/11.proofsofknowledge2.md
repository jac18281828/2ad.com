Introduction to proofs of knowledge - journal club - part 2

A proof of knowledge is a proof in which a *prover* can convince a *verifier* that it knows a secret.  Typically the goal is to do so without revealing the secret which arrives at _zero knowledge_ being expressed by the proving process.

In this discussion, I review the paper *On Defining Proofs of Knowledge,* by Bellare and Goldreich in an attempt to learn more about proofs of knowledge.   This is the introductory discussion with another more formal round to follow.
