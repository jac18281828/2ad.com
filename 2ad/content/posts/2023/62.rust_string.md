**Two Ways to Index a String in Rust**

*A Beginner Perspective*

As a relative newcomer to Rust, with experience programming in C and C++, I am used to being able to directly index a `String.` In these languages, indexing a string is a simple operation. However, in Rust, things are a bit different.

The first way to index a string in Rust is to use the `chars()` method. This method returns an iterator over the characters in the string. However, this is not the most efficient way to index a string.

```rust
    let string = "Hello, world!".to_string();
    let o = string.chars().nth(4).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", o);
```

The second way to index a string in Rust is to convert it to a vector of characters. This is the more efficient way to index a string, as it allows you to access individual characters by their index.

Here is an example of how to index a string in Rust:

```rust
    let string = "Hello, world!";
    let cvec = string.chars().collect::<Vec<char>>();
    println!("{:?}", cvec[4]);
```

In addition to the two methods discussed above, there are other ways to index a string in Rust. For example, you can use the `get()` method to get a reference to a character at a specific index.
