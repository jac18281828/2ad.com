[This](https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth/pull/59) PR introduces comprehensive testing in Solidity for the [did-eth-registry](https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth). By consolidating our tests within a single high-performance Solidity framework, we simplify future improvements and refactoring efforts. This approach also eliminates the need to switch between different language implementations, streamlining our development process.  Please review [here](https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth/issues/56) for additional information.
