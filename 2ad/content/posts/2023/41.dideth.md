# did:eth

[did:eth](https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth) is a project to develop a did method that is compatible with EVM.

I have submitted several proposals to improve the project and reach a prototype stage:

1. [Solidity Based Testing](https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth/issues/56)
2. [Standardized Contract Interface](https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth/issues/57)
3. [UUPS Proxy](https://github.com/veramolabs/did-eth/issues/58)

Please check out this project and add your support.
