#### Introduction to the EMOM Timer
EMOM Timer is a customizable timer designed for your workout.  EMOM Timer is developed using the Rust programming language and the Yew framework.  This is a completely new way to develop web applications.   The resulting application was easy to put together and is both performant and safe.

#### The Power of Rust and Yew
1. **WebAssembly and Performance**: Yew compiles to [WebAssembly (wasm)](https://webassembly.org/), thus EMOM Timer runs at near-native speed. This is crucial for a timer application where precision and responsiveness are key.
   
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: The use of a component-based architecture, similar to React and Vue.js, allows for a modular and maintainable codebase. This makes the EMOM Timer both scalable and easy to improve.

3. **Rust's Safety and Performance**: Leveraging Rust's strengths, the application ensures memory and thread safety, minimizing common bugs and enhancing overall reliability.

4. **Concurrency and Multi-Threading**: Thanks to Rust, EMOM Timer can efficiently utilize modern multi-core processors, ensuring smooth performance.

5. **JavaScript Interoperability**: The ability to interoperate with JavaScript enables the use of a vast array of existing libraries, making the timer more versatile.

6. **Rich Ecosystem and Tooling**: With Rust's growing ecosystem and tools like Cargo for package management, the development of the EMOM Timer benefits from a robust support system.

7. **Efficient Rendering with Virtual DOM**: Like React, Yew's virtual DOM ensures that only necessary parts of the DOM are updated, leading to enhanced performance.

8. **Declarative UI for Readability**: The declarative nature of Yew's UI design promotes readability and maintainability of the code.

9. **Familiar Syntax for React Developers**: Yew's macro-based syntax, similar to JSX, makes it accessible for developers with a React background.

10. **Strong Type System of Rust**: The Rust type system helps in catching errors early during the development phase, ensuring a more robust application【6†source】.

#### Conclusion
EMOM Timer is a fitness tool and a showcase of what can easily be achieved with Rust and Yew. It illustrates how high-performance, safe, and developer-friendly practices can come together in a rapid and easy to build package.
