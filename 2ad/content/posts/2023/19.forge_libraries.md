One feature that is missing in [Foundry and Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is the ability to [dynamically bind libraries](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/222).  In fact, it can be pretty difficult to understand how to bind libraries in general and the documenation is fairly lacking.   It took me several tries to get it right. 

![How do I link libraries with forge? Can't really find any docs]({static}/images/2023/forge_dynamic.png)

The docs are the [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-build)

Also here is an example of specifying a library which has been deployed previously in the call to `forge`, note the call to `--libraries:

```
$ forge script ./script/DeployTreasuryBuilder.sol --sig 'deploy()' --resume --libraries ./lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol:ECDSA:${ECDSA_LIB_ADDRESS} --slow --broadcast --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} --etherscan-api-key ${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY} --verify
```

<!--
More importantly here is an example of linking two libraries that have previously been deployed.  I first tried comma and colon separators and find the idea that I space is used here very confusing because the grammar is not consistent acrosss the whole command line.  Nevertheless a space works here.

```
$forge script ./script/DeployTreasuryBuilder.sol --sig 'deploy()' --resume --libraries contracts/Constant.sol:Constant:${CONSTANT_LIB_ADDRESS} ./lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol:ECDSA:${ECDSA_LIB_ADDRESS} --slow --broadcast --rpc-url ${RPC_URL} --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} --etherscan-api-key ${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY} --verify
```
