Two kids have sports tournaments this weekend.  We are eating some carbs.  I always like to boost it with a bit of protein powder.  The result is perfect protien brownies.

# Combine and mix

1. 5 oz chocolate - melt on stovetop double broiler
2. 2 eggs
3. 1 1/2 cup firmly packed brown suguar
4. 1 tsp vanilla extract
5. 1 scoop chocolate protien powder
6. 1/2 cup old fashioned oats
6. 1/2 tsp salt
7. almost a tablespoon of baking powder
8. 1/2 cup all purpose flour
9. 5 tbsp cocoa powder (unsweetened)
9. 1 cup (more) walnuts
10. The remainder of the bag of chocolate chips (8 oz bag)

# Bake

I preheat an iron skillet in a 350F/180C oven.   Remove, apply spray oil, then bake for 32 minutes.

Perfection!
