I've updated my multi-precision Fibonacci C++ package in Go lang as I am currently in the process of learning Go.    I was surprised at how easy it was to build this.   I'm becoming a reluctant convert to Go.  The implemntation complexity is comparable to Python and I'd say far easier than C++.   The performance is incredible, C-like.
