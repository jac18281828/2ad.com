I've updated my [multi-precision Fibonacci](https://github.com/jac18281828/mpfib) C++ package in Go.   I am currently in the process of learning Go and this is something I thought I could tackle.    I was surprised at how easy it was to build this.   I'm becoming a reluctant convert.  The implemntation complexity is comparable to Python and I'd say far easier than C++.   The performance is incredible, C-like.

I was able to compute F(50M) in about 30s on my i7 Mac.
