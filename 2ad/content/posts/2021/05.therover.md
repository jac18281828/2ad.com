![The Rover](https://ia601509.us.archive.org/14/items/therover_2102_librivox/rover_conrad_2102.jpg)

I recently finished reading [*The Rover*](https://librivox.org/the-rover-by-joseph-conrad/) by Joseph Conrad with a team of volunteers over at [librivox](https://librivox.org).   The Rover is a very interesting book and not as swashbuckling as the title might make it seem.   I could really relate to the character of Peyrol because in some ways he seems to be at a similar stage of life as I am myself.    The Rover isn't really about the adventures, past or present, one goes through but closer to relevancy and moral awakening.

I enjoyed it thoroughly.
