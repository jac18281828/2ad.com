I don't see why there could be anything wrong with making a Pumpkin Pie on any old Sunday.

Preheat 400F

Mix:

1. 2 cups raw pumpkin puree
2. 2 eggs (lightly beaten)
3. 1/4 cup raw sugar
4. 3/4 cup dark brown sugar
5. 2 tsp cinnamon
6. 1/2 tsp salt
7. 1/2 tsp fresh nutmeg
8. 1/2 tsp ginger - I like a bit more
9. 1/4 tsp allspice
10. pinch black pepper
11. 1 cup heavy cream
12. 1/3 cup milk

Pour in pie crust.  Bake 45 minutes.   Generally it is very wobbly.   If you like a firmer pie let it go for 10 more minutes.   Don't let it crack!
