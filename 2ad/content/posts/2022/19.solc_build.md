Building Solidity's compiler `solc` is nothing short of a bear.  It is using complex external dependencies like boost with some optional dependencies.  Moreover the build depends on specific versions of these packages.   This amount of complexity for a compiler is a topic of another post but it does give me alot of insight into `solc` performance.
