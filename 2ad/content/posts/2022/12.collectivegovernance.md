One of the really awesome aspects of developing an Ethereum Smart Contract for NFT Governance is that all the code is open source.   For the first time in the history of my career I can share what I am working on.

Currently I am developing a smart contract for community governance with [Collective](https://www.collective.xyz).   You can find the github repo here:
[Collective Governance](https://github.com/momentranks/collective-governance-v1)

There is also a reference implementation to call the contract on the js side [Example web3.js](https://github.com/momentranks/collective_governance_js)
