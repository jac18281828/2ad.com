There is shockingly poor support for docgen in Solidity.   Although it is possible to document your code in [NatSpec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html), one quickly discovers this is a trap.

The only output format available in `solc` is `json`.   And unfortunately that is not even actual `json` but a hybridized text and `json` log.  

It is apparent that a document generation phase is required.  However, after exploring all the available document generation tools available, there are many problems and challenges.  Many of the existing tools do not build with latest packages and tools and several have not been updated in 5 years or never worked well enough.   Thus it is a major challenge to publish docs from a solidity codebase.

I was able to get solidity docgen working by implementing a series of three different stages all automated in our build process.

1. Parse the `solc` output into actual json.
2. Load the `json` file into the documentation system
3. Use a [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) template to convert the api document


First, invoke `solc` to generate the document log

```
$ solc --devdoc --userdoc --include-path node_modules/ --base-path . contracts/* > ${DOCFILE}

```

Now `${DOCFILE}` contains the document spec data.   We want to parse this into `json` that a programmatic system can parse.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jac18281828/b9d056138242020626ad968169abd313.js"></script>

This script is invoked as follows:

```
parse_solcdoc.py ${DOCFILE} ${GENERATED_DOCFILE}
```

Finally this generated json can be used to build a contract specification from a template in [SPHINX](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).  Once you have configured your main site.     The `${GENERATED_DOCFILE}` can simply be loaded into the SPHINX conf.py.

I used the following code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jac18281828/809af1787f22895598c1c82c0f9a1396.js"></script>

This can be added to the sphinx setup hook in `conf.py`.

```
def setup(app):
    """
    sphinx setup hook
    """
    load_automated_docgen()    
```

The last step is to build a `jinja` template to output the automated docgen data in human readable format.   I used an api template in ReStructured Text:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jac18281828/78f21361c963328b8b67c19ce8e8200a.js"></script>

By combining these stages as part of out automated build we are able to produce generated documentation for our contracts.
