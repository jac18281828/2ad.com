Sometimes the Internet is guilty of having a supreme lack of trivial functional examples.   In the past trivial examples frequently functioned as the documentation for various libraries and utilities.  While that was probably what we refert to now as the 'bad old days.'  The modern focus on documentation and literate code seems to have supplanted the idea of an example at all.   Personally, I love working from an example and find that I can create a large and complex system simply by *tweaking* a simple 5 line code.

In that spirit, here is a simple functional example in TypeScript that calls a contract on Ethereum.
