If you want to apply a script to each file in a folder recursively you may not want the full relative path.   Here is how to remove it.

``` $ find . -type f -print | sed -e "s|^\./||g" ```

For example to combine it with xargs and invoke a script on each name it might look like this: 

``` $ find . -type f -print | sed -e "s|^\./||g" | xargs -Ipathsubst sh -c 'echo pathsubst' ```
