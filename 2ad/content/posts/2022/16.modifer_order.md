Solidity modifiers are evaluated from left to right.

Consider a `contract ModOrder` with state `FIRST` and `SECOND`:
```
    uint256 private constant FIRST = 1;
    uint256 private constant SECOND = 2;
```

If there are two modifiers that can not succeed:

```
    modifier requireNotFirst() {
        require(FIRST == FIRST - 1, "Not first");
        _;
    }

    modifier requireNotSecond() {
        require(SECOND == FIRST, "Not second");
        _;
    }
```

Then a function that requires both NotFirst and NotSecond in that order should revert with `Not First`.

```
    function notFirstNotSecond() public pure requireNotFirst requireNotSecond {
        revert("all good");
    }
```

Here is a complete example with a test:
