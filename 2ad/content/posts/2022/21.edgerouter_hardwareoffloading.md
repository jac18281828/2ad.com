I recently discovered [Hardware Offloading](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006567467-EdgeRouter-Hardware-Offloading) is not enabled by default on Unifi Edgerouter.   To enable it you must give up QoS.  However many small office networks don't need that and would benefit from the 3x performance boost instead.   I tried it on my network and I observed easily a 3x increase in 'speedtest'.  In my case it was closer to 5X because I fixed some other hardware issues at the same time.

Here are the commands to configure it:

```
configure

set system offload hwnat enable
set system offload ipsec enable

commit ; save
```
