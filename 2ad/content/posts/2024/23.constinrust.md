1️⃣ Static from Const: Rust 1.83+ lets you reference a static from a const—simplify and optimize your code

2️⃣ Compile-Time Precomputation: Use const for values computed at compile time, boosting performance

3️⃣ Const Generics for Arrays: Initialize arrays with const parameters and even precompute sequences like Fibonacci—just remember, loops aren’t allowed in const

Combine these techniques for clean, efficient, and precomputed logic in your Rust projects! 🦀
