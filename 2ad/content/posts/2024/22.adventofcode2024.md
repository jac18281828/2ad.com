## 2024 Advent of Code Repository

I have created a repository for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) challenges. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/jac18281828/advent-of-code-2024).

This year I'll be coding in Rust.

I'm using the basic setup as described in [How to set up Rust for Advent of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=fEQv-cqzbPg) by Chris Biscardi.  Thanks Chris!  Along with my Visual Studio Code Rust Remote Container [here](https://github.com/jac18281828/rust)
