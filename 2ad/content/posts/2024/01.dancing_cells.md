I found the discussion of "Dancing Cells" in Don Knuth's latest [lecture (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=622iPkJfYrI&list=PLoROMvodv4rOAvKVR_dyCigSBMcYjevYB&index=25) extremely relevant to blockchain programming.

The reason is this method of memory allocation is very similar to the method required to organize data as a `set` in Solidity. See [here](https://github.com/jac18281828/address_set/blob/2bc54d5a1d0f692a674108cfe02ea33106235f9b/contracts/AddressSet.sol#L26)

Here is a example implementation of some of the concepts covered written in a memory safty conscious language, e.g. rust:
