**_TO SURVIVE!_** 

Endure, never beaten, 

You are not a slave, enslaved; 

Dreading, take heart, 

Ferociously, as if mortally wounded. 

With the tenacity of a badly rusted nail; 

That in its age and ardor is still a nail; 

Not the featherbrained fearlessness of the turkey; 

Who is a coward when faced with real danger. 

Go as God, without tears, 

Or go as Lucifer, who does not pray, 

Or like the oak grove, whose greatness 

Needs water but does not beg for it… 

Bite and scream, avenging 

Your head still rolling in the dust!
