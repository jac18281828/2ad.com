**_TO GO ON!_** (Literal) 

Do not give up, do not be beaten, 

Do not feel like a slave, not even a slave; 

Tremor of dread, think bravo, 

And lash out fiercely, already badly wounded 

Have the tenacity of the moldy nail, 

That old and mean again becomes a nail; 

Not the cowardly fearlessness of the turkey; 

Who lessens his courage at the first noise. 

Proceed like God who never cries, 

Or like Lucifer who never prays, 

Or like the oak grove, whose greatness 

Needs water and does not implore it … 

Let him bite and shout avenging 

Your head already rolling in the dust!
