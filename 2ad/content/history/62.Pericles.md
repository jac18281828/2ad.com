## _person_ Pericles-
461 - 429 BCE-
A prominent figure in Athenian
politics during a time when Athenian power was at its height. This
time is known as The Age of Pericles and is marked by powerful
democratic influences in Athens. One of the most important government
bodies was a democratic institution known as the assembly, which
consisted of only male citizens over eighteen years of age. The
assembly passed all laws and made all decisions on foreign policy.
Pericles helped the democracy by increasing the availability of
governmental positions to the poor and lower classes. Changes
included offering pay for officeholders, which allowed the poor to
serve, and allowing lower-class citizens to hold government
positions.
