## _movement_  Jesuit-
1491-
The Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, was
  founded by a Spanish nobleman, Ignatius of Loyola,
    1491-
1556.
  Loyola was in many ways the antithesis of
  Martin Luther.  Though he believed in Luther's fundamental
  interpretation of church theology, his means to attain salvation was
  born out of absolute adherence to church doctrine.  The Jesuits
  preferred a highly disciplined devotion to scripture rather than the
  relaxed 'acceptance' doctrine espoused by the Lutherans.  The
  Jesuits believed in strict papal supremacy, see   Act of Supremacy.
