A group of Greek teachers and scholars in the fifth
century BCE who argued that attempts by humans to understand the
universe were futile. Sophists believed that the universe was
incomprehensible to the human mind, and that humans should strive to
improve their personal characteristics such as strength, stamina, and
intellect. Sophists stressed the importance of rhetoric, or
argument, and often made a living as wandering scholars
working as professional teachers. Sophists also characteristically
believed in relativism, i.e., that no absolute values exist in society
or culture, and each individual learns or adheres to their personal
value system.
