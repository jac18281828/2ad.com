  482-

-
Clovis was the leader of a Frankish
tribe who eventually unified and ruled all Franks.  Clovis converted
from paganism to become a Catholic Christian around    500 CE.

This conversion helped him gain papal support, as well as leading to
the eventual conversion of most of the Frankish peoples.  Clovis also
established the Merovigian dynasty.
