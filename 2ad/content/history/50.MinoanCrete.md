## _place_  Minoan Crete-
Isle of Crete, Northern Mediterranean-
The earliest
civilization in the Aegean region is called "Minoan Crete."  Minoan
Crete was a Bronze Age civilization,   2800 BCE.
  Minoan Crete
was discovered on the island of Crete by Arthur Evans.  The name
'Minoa' is taken from the name of a famous king of Crete, Minos.
Crete is also the location of the palace complex at Knossus.  Evidence
indicates that Minoan Crete was a very prosperous culture, with
far reaching sea trade.  Evidence indicates Minoans traded as far
south as Egypt.  Minoan civilization disappeared   1450 BCE.

Although, authorities differ there is evidence that Minoan Crete was
destroyed in a cataclysmic volcanic blast.
