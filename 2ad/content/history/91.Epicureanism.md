## _history_  Epicureanism-
Epicureanism is a system of belief based on
individual pleasure.   Epicurus,   341-
270 BCE,
 believed that
the gods did not play a major role in the lives of humans.  Instead he
espoused the belief that individuals should be motivated towards
self-satisfaction and the pursuit of personal rewards.  Epicureanism
is not synonymous with gluttony or hedonism, rather Epicurus believed
pleasure was derived from "freedom from emotional turmoil."
