## _writing_  Twelve Tables-
451 BCE-
Plebian pressure to codify Roman law
lead to a commission which created a set of twelve laws known as the
"Twelve Tables."  The "Twelve Tables" restricted the influence of
upper-classes and helped minimize arbitrary authority and tyranny. The
Twelve Tables cover many aspects of Roman society including family,
inheritance, slave ownership, crimes, and property ownership.
