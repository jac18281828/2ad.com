The marriage of Isabella
 of Castile, 1474-
1504,
 and Ferdinand of Aragon,
 1479-
1516,
 served to unify much of Christian and Muslim
 Spain. Though both kingdoms maintained separate governing
 institutions, the two rulers were able to strengthen the bond
 between the two kingdoms by strengthening their respective
 monarchies. Isabella and Ferdinand built a national military with
 the purpose of controlling the aristocracy. They arranged with the
 pope to be able to appoint the top position in the Spanish church,
 and made other changes which strengthened the monarchy as a whole.
