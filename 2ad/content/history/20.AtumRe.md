## _history_  Atum-Re-
The ancient Egyptian god of the Sun.  Atum was the
human form of the god, while Re was a figure with the body of a human
with the head of a falcon.  Ancient Egyptians believed that the Sun
was the fount of life.  The pharaoh was seen as the earthly embodiment
of Re, and therefore descendant, i.e. "son of Re."   This was the
source of the divine right in the Egyptian monarchy.
