## _person_ Nero-
 37-
68
-
Nero was a Roman Emperor who is widely
 regarded to have been inconsequential in his rule. It is said that
 Nero "fiddled while Rome burned." This statement may indicate
 that Nero had a propensity for good spirit and lack of
 leadership. Nero was deposed after a Spanish Revolt in 68. It is
 thought that Nero then committed suicide. See Seneca.
