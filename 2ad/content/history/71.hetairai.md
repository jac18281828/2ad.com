Greek: literally "female companions." An elite
class of prostitutes or courtesans. Hetairai were usually ex-slaves
or foreign nationals with a certain level of sophistication as
compared with other 'prostitutes.' Hetairai were dancers,
musicians and entertainers. Prostitution was not generally frowned
upon in ancient Greece, and therefore Hetairai also provided sex.
Some hetairai also grew wealthy and famous, one known as Aspasia was a
friend of Socrates. She was renowned for her learning, she was the
mistress of Pericles and eventually became his wife.
