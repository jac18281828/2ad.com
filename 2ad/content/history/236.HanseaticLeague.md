## _history_  Hanseatic League-
The Hanseatic League was formed in the
  thirteenth century.  Several German coastal towns, including
  L\"ubeck, Hamburg, and Bremen formed a commercial and military
  league to obtain commercial breaks and to protect themselves from
  pirates.  The League grew rapidly and by   1500
 it had grown to
  as many as eighty cities.  The Hanseatic League maintained a
  monopoly on trade of vital goods in northern Europe for centuries.
