The Hanseatic League was formed in the
 thirteenth century. Several German coastal towns, including
 L"ubeck, Hamburg, and Bremen formed a commercial and military
 league to obtain commercial breaks and to protect themselves from
 pirates. The League grew rapidly and by 1500
 it had grown to
 as many as eighty cities. The Hanseatic League maintained a
 monopoly on trade of vital goods in northern Europe for centuries.
