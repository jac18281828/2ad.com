## _person_  Ambrose-
  339-
397 CE
-
Ambrose of Milan created an image
of an ideal Christian bishop.  He advocated for a church which was
independent of state function and control.  He punished Emperor
Theodosius I for ordering the slaughter of citizens in Thessalonika
who refused to obey him.  The punishment was that Theodosius was not
allowed to participate in church.   Theodosius finally repented,
showing the massive power and political appeal the church had gained
by this time.
