## _person_  Justinian-
  527-
565 CE
-
Justinian became emperor of
the Byzantine Empire in   527 CE
 because he was nephew and heir to
the previous emperor.  Justinian married the daughter of a lower class
circus trainer named Theodora.  Justinian believed he could
reestablish the Roman empire throughout the Mediterranean.
Justinian's army was lead by Belisarius, who defeated the Vandals in
North Africa and occupied Sicily in    535 CE.
  Justinian's army
was unable to conquer Italy for another twenty years, and the war
proved to be brutal and destructive causing Italy to suffer greatly.
Though some believe that Justinian was over ambitious in his conquests,
leading to ultimate financial problems in his empire, it is clear that
he was partially successful in his goal to reunite much of territory
previously held by Rome.
