## _movement_  Protestant Reformation-
1513-
Spearheaded by Martin Luther,
  the Protestant Reformation set about to answer the question about
  what one must do to attain salvation.  Luther believed that church
  theology which included the   seven sacraments \ set an
  impossible task before good people who might deserve salvation.
  Luther's idea was that the "justice of God" was not a punitive
  recounting of ones individual folly, but a merciful acceptance
  wrought out of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.  The Reformation
  became very popular and spread rapidly, splintering the Catholic
  church into factions that exist to this day.
