After the death of Charlemagne, his
son Louis the Pious, 814-
840 CE
, succeeded him to the throne,
however the stability of the Empire soon came into question as
competing influences vied for the throne. In 843 CE
 after the
death Louis the Pious, his three sons signed the
Treaty of Verdun, an agreement to divide the Carolingian Empire into
three major sections. Charles the Bald, 843-
877 CE

western Frankish lands, which are now a part of France. Louis the
German, 843-
876 CE

, gained the middle
kingdom from the North~Sea down to Italy.
