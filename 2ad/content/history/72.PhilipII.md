## _person_  Philip II-
359 - 336 BCE-
Philip II was a king of Macedonia,
and father of famed conquerer   Alexander the Great.  Philip was an
admirer of Greek culture and Greek military acumen.  When Philip took
control of Macedonia he began to build a large army in order to ensure
the strength of the state.  Philip believed that the Greek's relied
too heavily on mercenaries, so he used Macedonian countrymen in his
army.  The army was funded through the gold extracted from the gold
mines of Mount Pangaeus.  Philip's army was also armed with longer
spears than the Greeks.  As Philip's power and reach grew in Macedonia,
the Greeks grew more and more nervous.  Athens finally undertook an
offensive near Thebes in   338 BCE.
  The Macedonian army defeated the
Greeks, and this conflict eventually lead Philip to have control over
the entire region.  Philip was the victim of political assassination
in   336 BCE.
