## _event_ Great Schism-
1377-
After determining that a decline
 in papal authority was due, at least in part, to an Avignon Papacy
,
 Pope Gregory XI returned the seat of papal power to Rome.
 Unfortunately, in 1378
 Gregory died, resulting in a new
 struggle for papal power. Many Roman cardinals feared that the
 powerful enclave of French cardinals would elect another French pope
 who would reestablish the Avignon Papacy. The Roman Cardinals
 threatened the French cardinals with death if they did so, and the
 Italian archbishop of Bari was elected and anointed Pope Urban~VI.
 However, the victory was temporary since five months later the
 French cardinals declared the election improper. The French
 cardinals elected Clement VII, a Frenchman to resume the Avignon
 Papacy and the resulting power struggle is known as the Great
 Schism. The division of the Papacy caused great turbulence in
 the Catholic church, damaged the faith of the believers, and
 resulted in increased taxes and corruption. Eventually the Papacy
 returned to Rome, but not before much damage was done to the church.
