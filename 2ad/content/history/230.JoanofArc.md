Joan of Arc was the
 daughter of peasants from the village of Domr'emy in Champagne.
 Joan was deeply religious and is known to have experienced visions.
 She believed that several saints commanded her to free France
 and to return rule to the dauphin, or rightful heir. Joan of Arc
 persuaded Charles, the dauphin, to allow her to accompany a French
 army to Orl'eans. The French armies seemed inspired by Joan of
 Arc's confidence and liberated Orl'eans. Soon the Loire valley was
 free and Charles was able to claim the monarchy in 1429.

 Unfortunately, Joan of Arc was captured shortly thereafter by the
 Burgundians, who were allies of England. Joan was turned over to the
 Inquisition on charges of witchcraft, because her visions were
 deemed to be satanic. The church condemned her as a witch and
 burned her at the stake. Ironically, Joan was sainted by the Roman
 Catholic church in 1920, about 500 years too late.
