Latin: literally natural law. The
Romans believed, at least in principal, that the rights of individuals
are inalienable from them. This precept maintains that a person is
innocent until proven guilty, and that all people should be equal in
the eyes of the law and government. Though this precept has been held
in regard to law since the time of the ancient Romans, history, from the
time of Rome until now, proves that the states do not always maintain
these rights in the sense they are described. See ius gentium.
