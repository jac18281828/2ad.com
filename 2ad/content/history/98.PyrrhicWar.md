## _history_  Pyrrhic War-
  267 BCE
 -- A series of battles between
Rome and King Pyrrhus of Epirus.  As the Greeks came into contact
with Rome, resulting from Roman expansion across the Italian
Peninsula, they increasingly experienced conflict.  The Greeks, who
relied heavily on mercenaries, bought the aid of King Pyrrhus of
Epirus to help in staving off the Romans.  King Pyrrhus was able to
defeat the Romans in two subsequent battles, where he raised armies of
20,000 or more and crossed the Adriatic Sea with them.  Though King
Pyrrhus was considered to have won the battles, the victories were
thought to have cost more than they gained.   King Pyrrhus even
remarked that winning one more battle would ruin him, hence the phrase
  Pyrrhic victory. \   His words nearly rang true, when Rome decisively
defeated King Pyrrhus,   267 BCE.
  This allowed the Romans to
expand into Southern Italy and gain control over the Greek city states.
