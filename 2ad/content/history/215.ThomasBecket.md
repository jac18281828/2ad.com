## _person_ Thomas Becket-
 1160
-
Thomas Becket was archbishop of
 Canterbury in the twelfth century. Becket was England's highest
 ranking cleric when he became embroiled in a political
 controversy. The powerful king, Henry II, 1154-
1189,
 wanted
 the right to punish clergy in the royal court. However, Becket
 resisted claiming that only the church should have the right to
 punish clergy. Failing at compromise, the two officials struggled
 openly until Henry plead for someone to rid him of the archbishop.
 Four knights consented and assassinated Becket, resulting in a
 resolution to the controversy.
