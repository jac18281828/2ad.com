## _history_  Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus-
Tiberius Gracchus,
  163-
133 BCE,
 was a member of the   nobiles. \ He was
concerned with the shortage of military recruits, and attempted to
create some reforms to improve the situation in Rome.  Tiberius
believed that the primary problems in Rome stemmed from the demise of
the family farm, so he introduced policies to redistribute huge tracts
of lands to the landless poor in the plebian assembly.  The measures
were passed, however it was likely too late to save Rome from the
civil wars that would plague it in the coming years.  Though Tiberius
was popular with the plebians, his reform had major impacts on wealthy
landowners in the senate, who conspired and eventually assassinated
him.  Tiberius' brother Gaius was elected tribune in   123-
122
BCE
 and carried the torch of reform passed on by his brother.  Gaius
restored the traditional judicial powers and quickened the
redistribution of land.  The reforms of these brothers demonstrated
the conflicts of interest between the powerful landed aristocracy and
the poorer classes in Rome.
