1098-
The Cistercian order of monks
 evolved because some monks became disenchanted by the lack of strict
 discipline in the Benedictine orders. Cistercian beliefs spread
 rapidly. Monks from this order were required to eat a simple diet,
 wear only a single robe, and eliminate any type of decoration or
 adornment from monasteries and churches. Cistercians did not
 utilize peasant labor to work their lands. The Cistercians tended
 to live on uninhabited lands and wastelands. While the Cistercians
 attempted to live lives separate from the inhabited world, they were
 so successful in reforming their lands that they ended up
 controlling vast and productive tracts of farm land.
