## _people_  Persians-
The Eastern Mediterranean Region, Middle East into
Asia-
An enormous empire established in large part due to the
expansive conquests of   Cyrus the Great.   The Persians had conquered
nearly every Middle-Eastern civilization and created a huge empire by
  500 BCE.
  The Persians were an Indo-European speaking people
related to the Medes, they lived on the Western Iranian plateau South
of the Caspian Sea.   The Persians Empire lasted for nearly three
centuries,   550 - 331 BCE.
   Cyrus the Great
 was the
most notable leader of the Persians, but other leaders, such as Cyrus'
son Cambyses, are responsible for further expansion of the
Empire.  The Persians were said to have allowed greater freedom in
subject kingdoms, and established a system of hierarchical rule
allowing individual subject kingdoms to retain a degree of autonomy.
The individual freedoms allowed under the rule of the Persians is
widely attributed as one of the many reasons for the success of this
empire.
