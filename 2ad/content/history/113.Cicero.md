## _person_ Cicero-
 106-
43 BCE
-
Marcus Tullius Cicero was an
outsider and first in his family to hold the consulship. Cicero was
known as an excellent orator, and made a name for himself as a
lawyer. Cicero became consul in 63 BCE.
 Cicero tried to
establish a new period of cooperative rule in Roman government,
similar to the collective governments of the past, however the pursuit
was fraught with complications. Cicero believed there was a need for a
powerful military leader to be supported by the senate, but could not
fulfill the role himself. He encouraged the Senate to support Pompey,
however many in the Senate felt that Pompey was already too powerful.
