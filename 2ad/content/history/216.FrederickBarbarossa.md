Frederick Barbarossa,
 known as Fredrick I, was a powerful lord who was elected king in
 Central Europe. Frederick wanted to further incorporate Italy into
 the German kingdom to form a Holy Empire or Holy Roman Empire. The
 papal states and northern Italian cities resisted and Fredrick was
 defeated at Legnano in 1176.
