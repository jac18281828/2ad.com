## _person_  Martin Luther-
  1483-
1546
-
Martin Luther was an
  educated man who dedicated himself to monastic life at the age of
  twenty-two.  Luther became obsessed with a simple question: What is
  the minimum one must do to attain salvation?   Luther believed that
  church doctrine set an impossible task before anyone wishing to
  attain salvation, and resolved to find a new interpretation of
  church doctrine that resolved the question.  Luther's answer, known
  as the   Protestant Reformation
 revolutionized the
  Christian religion and created a new church doctrine that was
  rapidly adopted.  However, Luther's view was not accepted by all.   The
  catholic church excommunicated him, and the Holy Roman Emperor made
  him an outlaw.   Nonetheless, Luther's view had caught hold of the
  people, and attempts to stifle Luther couldn't stop the rapidly
  advancing religious reform.


## _person_  Erasmus-
  1466-
1536
-
Desiderius Erasmus was one of the
  most important Christian humanists.  Erasmus was determined to
  reconcile faith and reason through the common themes of
  classical ethics and Christian morality.  He published a book known
  as   Handbook of the Christian Knight, \ in   1503.

  Erasmus' book espoused a 'philosophy of Christ' over restrictive
  church doctrine.  Erasmus also published a revised and edited
  edition of the Bible in   1516.
  Though Erasmus' reforms did
  not become widely accepted, it is thought that these reforms paved
  the way for the Protestant Reformation.
