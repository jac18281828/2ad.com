## _history_  Hieroglyphics-
Greek: literally 'sacred writings.'  A system of
pictographic writing used by the ancient Egyptians to depict objects
and to convey a sense of sacred value.   Hieroglyphs did not serve as
a phonetic alphabet and conveyed strictly pictographic
representations.  Many hieroglyphs were carved in stone, but the
Egyptians also notably used paper made from papyrus reed to create
documents of record.
