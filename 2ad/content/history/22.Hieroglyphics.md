Greek: literally 'sacred writings.' A system of
pictographic writing used by the ancient Egyptians to depict objects
and to convey a sense of sacred value. Hieroglyphs did not serve as
a phonetic alphabet and conveyed strictly pictographic
representations. Many hieroglyphs were carved in stone, but the
Egyptians also notably used paper made from papyrus reed to create
documents of record.
