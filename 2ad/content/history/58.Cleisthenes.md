-
An Athenian aristocrat who
gained control of government and established the basis for Athenian
democracy. Cleisthenes created a hierarchical government composed of
ten tribes of Athenian citizens and a ruling council of 500 members
who were elected by the tribes. Cleisthenes' reforms served to
decrease the power of aristocrats in favor of local citizenry, and
also to increase the loyalty of citizens to the polis.
