## _history_  Delphic Oracle-
A temple located in Delphi where a priestess
listened to questions, and delivered responses that were said to be
from the Greek God Apollo.   The priestess listened to the questions
in a state of ecstasy that was believed to be caused by Apollo.
Priests interpreted the responses and returned the answers to the
querent in verse form.  Responses were generally vague, general, or
complicated by multiple interpretations.
