## _history_  Estates-General-
The Estates-General or French Parliament was
  a political organization in the fourteenth century.   The
  Estates-General was made up of representatives from clergy, nobility
  and the common people.   The Estates-General did not hold significant
  power, and was mostly subordinate to the rule of the king.  Since
  the burden of taxation weighted heavily on the French people, the
  Estates-General made a deal with the monarchy when an emergency
  increase in taxes was required to ransom King John II.  The
  Estates-General acquiesced to the taxes, on condition that once the
  dauphin, John's son Charles, gained power, all taxation must be
  approved by the Estates-General.  Though it was a valiant attempt,
  the political coalition eventually collapsed under the weight of the
  powerful monarch, Charles V.
