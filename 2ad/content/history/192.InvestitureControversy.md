## _history_ Investiture Controversy-
Although German kings frequently
 appointed high-ranking clergy to important civic positions, Pope
 Gregory issued a decree, in 1075,
 which banned the practice.
 King Henry IV, 1056-
1106
, who was no stranger to the
 practice, fiercely opposed the decree since his Investiture of the
 bishop of Milan, the second most important position in the clergy
 was essential to his authority in northern Italy. Gregory
 threatened the king with excommunication, and the king called a
 meeting of German bishops to depose the pope. Henry was finally
 excommunicated giving the fickle nobility opportunity to call his
 rule into question. Henry finally succumbed and plead for
 absolution. Gregory granted it, and the issue was later resolved
 by the Concordat of Worms in 1122.
