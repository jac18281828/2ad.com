## _history_  Teutonic Knights-
The Teutonic Knights were established in the
  end of the twelfth century to protect the Christian Holy Land.
  These knights later used their military power to gain wealth
  by raiding and pillaging the Slavic nations in eastern Europe.   The
  Teutonic Knights waged war on the Slavic peoples for thirty years,
  until, by the end of the thirteenth century, most of the people of
  Prussia had been converted, killed or driven out by the knights.
