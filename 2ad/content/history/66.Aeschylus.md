## _person_  Aeschylus-
525 - 456 BCE-
The first known tragedian.
Aeschylus wrote as many as ninety tragedies, or Greek Dramas.  Though only
seven survive to this day, much is known about them.   Aeschylus'
tragedies followed a similar format used in other Greek Tragedies.
His stories tended to center around a single tragic event, and his
characters tended to embody a single human drive or characteristic.
