## _movement_  Flagellant-
1348-
The Flagellant movement emerged as a
  result of the   Black Death.  The Flagellants believed that the Black
  Death was a punishment meted out by God to force atonement for the
  evils and sins of the European people.  The Flagellant were
  especially popular in Germany.  They wandered from town to town
  beating themselves with whips to win the forgiveness of God.
