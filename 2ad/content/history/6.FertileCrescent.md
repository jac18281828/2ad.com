## _place_ Fertile Crescent-
Asia Minor and Middle East, North of Arabian
Peninsula-
A crescent shaped area of fertile land in the Middle
East. The civilizations of Sumeria, Phoenicia, Assyria, and Babylon
developed in the Fertile Crescent. The Fertile Crescent surrounds the
flood planes of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. The constant
flooding of these rivers results in a fertile soil that encourages the
establishment of agrarian communities, and thus nurtures civilization.
This region is also known to be home to wild plant and animal species
which early humans domesticated.
