## _people_ Magyars-
Western Asia-
The Magyars were encouraged to attack
the Bulgars by the Byzantine emperors, while the Bulgars urged the
Pechenegs to attack the Magyars. The Magyars were eventually forced
into eastern and central Europe by the Pecheneg pressure. The Magyars
built a strong presence in Hungary and made many raids on Germany,
France and Italy, until they were defeated at the Battle of Lechfeld
in Germany, 955 CE.
 The Magyars were converted to Christianity
in the tenth century, and later they established the kingdom of Hungary.
