organized rule known as the Roman Confederation. The Roman
Confederation consisted of Rome and it's conquered client states, and
was signified by domination on the part of Rome. The Confederation
was established through treaties with a conquered peoples or
kingdoms. Rome allowed the kingdom to retain some freedom, and
provided them with some services of the Roman Republic, and in

citizenship, the ability to marry or make contracts with Romans, or
other specialized relationships. The Roman Confederation eventually
expanded to encompass all of Italy.
