355 - 323 BCE-
Alexander was the son of
Philip II who took control of Greece and Macedonia after the death of
his father, 336 BCE.
 Alexander is popularly known as
"Alexander the Great" because of his conquest of much of
the Mediterranean region, Asia-minor, including the territory once held
by the Persian Empire, the middle east, and even part of India.
Alexander spent most of his time as king campaigning against neighboring
city-states and expanding his empire. Unfortunately, his aggressive
campaigning also lead to his downfall, when in 323 BCE
 he died
of wounds received in battle. Alexander's legacy of conquest remains
even today, and is probably attributable in large part to the
excellent army built by his father. Numerous cities named
'Alexandria' are named after him, including one of the largest cities
in Egypt. Alexander's principal legacy is the dissemination of Greek
culture throughout the entire region of his empire in the short time of
his reign. This legacy of Greek culture is one of the primary reasons
why Greek culture remains so important in Western Civilization today.
