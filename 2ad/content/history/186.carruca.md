## _history_  carruca-
A   carruca \ is a heavy, wheeled plow, that
  revolutionized agriculture in the high middle ages,
   .  The   aratum , a light, wooden, non-wheeled
  plow was used previously.  The   aratum \ could be
  effective in the light soil regions of the Mediterranean, however it
  was ineffective in the dense clay soils of northern and central
  Europe.   The development of the   carruca \ was essential to the
  success of agriculture in Europe, since it allowed
  farmers to till the dense soil of the region with greater ease.
