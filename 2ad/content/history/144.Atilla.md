Atilla was ruler of the Huns in
the fifth century. Atilla is known to have been a formidable opponent in
battle, and the Huns in general were said to be savage combatants.
This greatly influenced the Hun dynasty and Atilla expanded his empire
to become one of the largest in the ancient world. Nonetheless, in
451, he was repelled by the Visigoths, a defeat which likely prevented
him from conquering the Western as well as Eastern World.
