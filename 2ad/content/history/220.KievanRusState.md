## _history_  Kievan Rus State-
The Kievan Rus state became formally
  Christian in 987 and prospered afterward.   The Kievan society was
  dominated by a noble class of landowners.  The noble population was made
  up of the Scandinavians, also known as the Rus, and the chiefs of
  the old Slavic Tribes.   The Kievan Rus were free, however as in
  other regions, the peasant class had to endure hard labor and long hours.
