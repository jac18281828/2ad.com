## _person_ Sulla-
 138-
78 BCE
-
Lucius Cornelius Sulla was a
member of the nobiles, who was made consul in 88 BCE.
During Sulla's consularship, the plebian assembly gave Marius command
of the army. Sulla regarded this action as illegal, and used his
army to march on Rome and reestablish control. Marius fled, however
when Sulla left to attend to the war against Mithridates, Marius
joined forces with the consul Cinna, and marched on Rome to seize
control of the government once again. Marius used his power to remove
Sulla, and kill many of Sulla's supporters. Sulla defeated
Mithridates and returned to Rome to use his armies to once again seize
power. In the ensuing turmoil Sulla convinced the senate to name him
dictator to "reconstitute the republic." Sulla used his power to
oppressed and kill his opponents, and later to revise the constitution
to restore power to the senate. Sulla eliminated the plebian assembly
and attempted to restore order to the Roman Republic. Sulla's reforms
ultimately proved futile as civil wars destroyed the Roman Republic.
