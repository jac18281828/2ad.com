## _person_  Hannibal-
  246-
183 BCE
-
Hannibal Barca was a
Carthaginian general who was sworn to hatred of Rome by his father,
Hamilcar Barca.  Hannibal lead Carthage in several successful battles
against Rome in the Punic Wars.  Hannibal marched across the Alps with
a significant army built of Spanish natives, however there were many
casualties and he was later required to augment his force with Guallic
reinforcements.  Hannibal defeated the Romans at Trebia River, and
again at Trasimene in Etruria.    Though the Romans were able to delay
Hannibal's advance for some years, they eventually determined that they
must confront him.  In   216 BCE,
 Hannibal won a decisive victory
at Cannae, killing as many as 40,000 Romans.   Though Rome suffered
serious losses, they recovered and eventually sent an army directly
against Carthage, this forced Hannibal to withdraw from northern Italy,
and allowed the Romans to attain the victory they had been struggling
for.  In   202 BCE,
 Rome defeated Hannibal at the Battle of
Zama.  The Carthagians were forced into a peace treaty with Rome,
which required them to relinquish control of Spain to the Romans.
