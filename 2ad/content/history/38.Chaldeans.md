## _people_  Chaldeans-
The Levant, Eastern Mediterranean-
The Chaldeans or
Neo-Babylonians were a semitic speaking people with origins on the
Arabian Peninsula. The Chaldeans and the Medes captured the Assyrian
capital Nineveh in   612 BCE.   This allowed them to establish a
new monarchy.   Nebuchadnezzar
 II finally defeated the Assyrians around
  604 BCE,
 and also defeated Egypt to gain control of Syria and
Palestine.   Nebuchadnezzar
 destroyed Jerusalem, the center of Hebrew
worship, and forced the Hebrew people into exile in Babylon.  The
Chaldeans are widely noted for their prosperity, including the
development of one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the
"Hanging Gardens."  The Chaldean Empire lasted less than 100 years,
  605-
539 BCE.
 Around   539 BCE
 internal religious
disputes, and subsequent conquest by Persian king   Cyrus the Great
 lead
to the downfall of the empire.
