 -- The pharaoh Ahmose I
defeated and expelled the Hyksos from Egypt, reuniting the kingdom to end
the age of chaos. This established the eighteenth dynasty and a period
of Egyptian civilization historians refer to as "The New Kingdom."
This period of Egyptian civilization was marked by improvements in
warfare and the maintenance of state. During this period Viziers, who
were primarily responsible for the maintenance of state, were selected
exclusively from military commanders.  Egypt's military strength
contributed to its becoming one of the most powerful states in the
region.
