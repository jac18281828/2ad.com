## _history_  Delian League-
  478 BCE
 -- A confederation of Greek
city-states designed to resist Persian imperialism.  The Delian League
cemented the political power of the Athenians, while at the same time
the Spartans shied away from international politics.  The headquarters
of the Delian League was on the Island of Delos, central to the Ionian
Greeks, however the Athenians occupied positions of political
importance including the treasurers and commanders of the fleet.
The Delian League freed Greek city-states under Persian control and
successfully defeated the Persian army and navy.
