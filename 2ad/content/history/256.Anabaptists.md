## _movement_  Anabaptists-
1525-
Following the path paved by the
  Protestant Reforms the Anabaptists pushed for further reformation of
  church doctrine.  Anabaptists tended to be peasants and working
  poor.   The Anabaptists believed in adult baptism, rather than
  infant baptism, taking the approach that all believers were baptized
  into the church of their own accord and thus were conferred with the
  same rights and privileges.  The Anabaptists attempted to live in
  accordance with early villages described in the New Testament, they
  organized democratic communities where each and every believer was
  seen as sharing the same rights.  Further, the Anabaptists believed
  in secular government, they refused to hold political office or bear
  arms.
