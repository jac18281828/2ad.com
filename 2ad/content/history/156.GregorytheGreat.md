## _person_  Gregory the Great-
  590-
604 CE
-
 Gregory the Great
became pope and gained control of Rome around the seventh century CE.
Gregory organized Rome and its surrounding territories into a system
of government known as the Papal States.  Gregory probably established
control in Rome to prevent further damage from the Lombards who had
warred with Rome in the preceding century.  Gregory successfully
converted England and many Germanic peoples to Christianity by
sending missionaries abroad.   Gregory is also well known for his
correction to the Julian Calendar.   The Julian calendar provided for
an extra day each February, however Gregory amended the calendar to
the current system in which certain years do not have leap years based
on a fixed schedule that allows the calendar to stay synchronized with
the seasons to a very high degree of accuracy.
