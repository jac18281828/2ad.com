## _person_  Hugh Capet-
  987-
996 CE
-
When the power and authority of
the Frankish kings diminished in the West, the nobles chose Hugh
Capet, count of Orl\'eans and Paris to become king.  The political
intent of their choice is revealed in the fact that Capet was a minor
land owner whose primary control was over the Ile-de-France.   The
nobles hoped to place a king who would not be able to build a
formidable dynasty with his limited resources.
Though Capet died in a campaign to Spain,   996 CE
, he did
succeed in convincing the court to allow his son to succeed him to the
throne.
