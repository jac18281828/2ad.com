Growing
 tensions between the King of England, Edward III, and Philip VI of
 France resulted in a Hundred Years' War. Edward III was duke of
 Gascony, which meant he must swear allegiance as a vassal of the King
 of France, however, tensions between the two and political
 disagreements over the fate of the territory of Gascony caused
 Edward to refuse allegiance and declare war on Phillip. The
 disputes waged on and off for more than one hundred years, until
 Joan of Arc intervened. Charles the dauphin, heir to the French
 Throne, was established as monarch in 1429
 and though the war
 waged on for two more decades, the tone for the conflict had been
 established and England was forced out of French territory by
 1461.
