At it's height, in the fifteenth century the
 House of Medici was the most prominent banking family in Europe.
 Originally a cloth producer, the Medicis gained great power in
 commerce, real estate and finance that spread throughout northern
 Italy, France, and even into England. The Medici family's power
 declined after a series of bad leaders and failed loans resulted in
 significant losses.
