 1356 -
During the Hundred Years' War
 King John II was
 captured at the Battle of Poitiers. This event largely signified the
 end of the first phase of the War. The English demanded a large
 ransom and territorial concession for John's release. In return, the
 English agreed to forsake any claim to the French throne.
