## _history_  troubadours-
A troubadour was a strolling minstrel or lyric
  poet.   Troubadours were French, Italian and Spanish composers who
  sang and wrote about courtly love.


## _history_  Romanesque and Gothic Cathedrals-
Romanesque and Gothic
  cathedrals are typified by two distinct types of architecture.  The
  Romanesque cathedral was usually a rectangular basilica style
  similar to a fortress or castle.   The Romanesque cathedral was
  limited in size because of the weaknesses of its rectangular,
  monolithic, construction.
  Gothic cathedrals superseded the limitations of the Romanesque
  cathedrals and could be built much taller.
  The Gothic cathedral is typified by spires, arched or domed ceilings
  and the architectural feature known as 'flying buttresses.'   Flying
  buttresses supported the walls of the tallest cathedrals and
  allowed the cathedral to be built taller with thinner walls.
