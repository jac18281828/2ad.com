A dualistic religion of the Persian Empire after
 600 BCE.
 Zoroastrianism is a religious system attributable to
the prophet Zoroaster, 660 BCE.
 Tenants of Zoroastrianism
include the duality of a 'god of light' and a 'god of darkness' who
struggle for influence over humanity. Zoroastrianism assumes
adherents have free-will, with which, they can choose between the god
of light and god of darkness. Adherents believe that humans will
ultimately be faced with a final judgment, at which time Ahuramazda will
determine their fate for eternity. Given the similarities of
Zoroastrianism and Christianity, it is likely that portions of
Christianity are influenced by Zoroastrianism.
