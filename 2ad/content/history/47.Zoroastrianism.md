## _history_  Zoroastrianism-
A dualistic religion of the Persian Empire after
  600 BCE.
 Zoroastrianism is a religious system attributable to
the prophet Zoroaster,   660 BCE.
  Tenants of Zoroastrianism
include the duality of a 'god of light' and a 'god of darkness' who
struggle for influence over humanity.  Zoroastrianism assumes
adherents have free-will, with which, they can choose between the god
of light and god of darkness. Adherents believe that humans will
ultimately be faced with a final judgment, at which time Ahuramazda will
determine their fate for eternity.   Given the similarities of
Zoroastrianism and Christianity, it is likely that portions of
Christianity are influenced by Zoroastrianism.
