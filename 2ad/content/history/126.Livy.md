## _person_ Livy-
 59 BCE-
17 CE
-
Livy was an important Roman
historian. His crowning work, History of Rome, encompassed 142
books and chronicled the history of the city from its inception to
 9 BCE.
 Livy was originally from northern Italy, but came to
reside in Rome for his later life. It is believed that Livy valued
history as a tool for teaching "moral lessons," though his work is
said to have heralded the "greatness" of Rome. Unfortunately, Livy
was known to subordinate factual accuracy in favor of retelling, and
some of his work is of questionable historical character.
