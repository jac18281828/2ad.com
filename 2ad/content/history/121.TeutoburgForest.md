## _place_  Teutoburg Forest-
  Germania \ or Germany-
  9 CE
 --
Though the reign of Augustus was generally marked by military triumph
and successes, Augustus did fail to expand the Roman empire beyond the
natural borders established in the North.  In particular, at the
Battle of Teutoburg Forest, Augustus was soundly defeated.  The Romans
lost about 20,000 troops or about three legions trying to gain
influence in   Germania.
