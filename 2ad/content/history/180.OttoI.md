## _person_  Otto I-
  936-
973 CE
-
Otto I was one of the best known
kings of the Saxons in Germany.  Otto I defeated the Magyars at
Lechfeld in   955 CE
, and encouraged conversion of Slavic and
Scandinavian peoples to Christianity.  Otto I incorporated the power of
the church more heavily into his kingdom than previous rulers had,
since he relied on Bishops and Abbots for governing his kingdom.
Because they were celibate, the governmental service of Bishops and
Abbots helped allay the formation of governmental dynasties in which a
single land owner and his children became entrenched with political
power down through the generations.  Otto I was crowned Emperor of the
Romans by the pope in   962 CE,
 however the political will to
expand into Italy was of little consequence as future Frankish kings
would find it difficult and then impossible to maintain the
subservience of the Italian counts.
