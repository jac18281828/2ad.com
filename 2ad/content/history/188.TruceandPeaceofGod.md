## _history_ Truce and Peace of God-
In the eleventh century the Catholic
church instituted the Peace of God to stop knights from constantly
battling each other and especially to stop them from hurting and
killing noncombatant persons such as clergy, the poor, merchants and
women. The church urged knights to take an oath of respect for holy
centers. The Truce of God was instituted by the church to prevent
bloodshed on the sabbath and primary feast days.
