## _history_  Stoicism-
Stoicism was a system of thought which became the
most popular philosophy in the Hellenistic world.  Although, Stoicism
deals with personal happiness, it differs from Epicureanism in that it
contends that the best means to achieve happiness is through living in
harmony with the intentions of the gods.  Stoics believed that the
best existence would be a virtuous and natural one.  One of the
primary tenants of Stoicism was the acceptance of the will of God. Our
modern term 'stoic' results from the cultural beliefs of the Stoics.
