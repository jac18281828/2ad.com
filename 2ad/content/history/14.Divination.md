The art and practice of attempting to foretell or
obtain knowledge concerning future events, the supernatural, or divine
will. Divination frequently implies the use of characteristic
 tools of the trade, for example, foretelling events through
interpretation of animal remains, shape of smoke columns, dice rolls,
predictive cards, etc. Divination was carried out by priests in
ancient religions to reveal the fate of the people and the intention
of the gods.
