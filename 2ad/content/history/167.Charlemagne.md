## _person_  Charlemagne-
  768-
814 CE
-
Charles the Great or
Charlemagne was a charismatic and powerful ruler of the Frankish
peoples.  He was said to be very intelligent, aggressive, capable on
the battlefield, and an exceptional statesman.  Charlemagne undertook
fifty-four military campaigns with the small Frankish army, about
8,000 men.  Charlemagne's aggressive military strategy helped expand
the Carolingian Empire throughout Europe, ultimately culminating in
his control of much of Germany, Italy, Saxony and part of Spain.
Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of Rome in    800 CE,
 however the
meaningfulness of this title is in some dispute considering the
relationship of Charlemagne with the popes, and the supreme papal
power in this time period.
