## _history_  Act of Supremacy-
The   Jesuit
 movement borrowed
  from Lutheranism in spirit, but fundamentally turned Martin~Luther's
  conclusions upside down.  The Jesuits declared strict allegiance to
  the Pope.  The Jesuits' absolute obedience became an organized
  extension of the popes authority.
