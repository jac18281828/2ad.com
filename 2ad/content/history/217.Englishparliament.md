The English parliament established,
 1300,
 was one of the primarily democratizing influences in the
 English monarchy. Originally parliament was used to refer to the
 meeting of the kings council, however, Edward I invited two knights
 from every county and two representatives from each city and town
 to meet and consent to new taxes.
