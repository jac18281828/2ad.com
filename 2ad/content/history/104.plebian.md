## _history_  plebian-
The plebians were the large body of the lower
classes in Rome.  The plebians were independent, and generally did not
have large landholdings.  Although, the plebians did not hold the same
right to govern as the patricians did initially.  The efforts of some
of the wealthier plebians, eventually allowed the plebian-class greater
influence in Roman government.  See   patricians.
