## _history_ fasces-
The fasces are an important symbol of power
and the authority used by the Etruscans. It was adopted by the
 Romans
 and used until modern times. Even Mussolini used it as a
symbol of his government. The symbol then became associated with the
term "fascism." The fasces are represented by an axe
surrounded by a bundle of rods tied with a red thong. The axe
represents power, and the rods represent the citizens of the state,
bound together in common interest. The fasces also became an
important symbol of the Roman state, and Roman consuls were always
preceded by twelve lictors bearing fasces.
