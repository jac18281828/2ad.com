## _person_ Aristotle-
384 - 322 BCE-
Aristotle was one of Plato's
students, and remains one of the most important thinkers in Western
Civilization to this day. Although Aristotle believed in universal
forms, like Plato, Aristotle did not agree with Plato's idea of ideal
forms. Aristotle believed that form and matter were inseparable and
that each physical object encompasses the totality of its form, without
extension beyond itself. Aristotle's teachings played an important
role in the development of Western Civilization. Aristotle believed
in a guarded equality of the sexes, mostly asserting that women must
be happy and productive for society to be complete, however, he did
not view women as the equals of men. On the contrary he viewed them
as inferior or incomplete "males."
