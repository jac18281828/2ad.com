## _history_  Jacquerie-
The   Jacquerie \ was a French peasant
  revolt which broke out in   1358.
  The peasants were frustrated
  with the turmoil that resulted from the   Black Death
 and the
  Hundred Years' War.  The peasants were persecuted by both Merchants, who
  lived off of peasant lands as they traveled, and the military who had
  deliberate policies to lay waste to peasant lands.  Revolution was
  the natural result, however, the peasants were quickly quelled as
  the nobles exerted their power and authority, massacring and
  disbanding the rebels.
