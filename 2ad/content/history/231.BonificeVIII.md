## _person_  Bonifice VIII-
  1294-
1303
-
Pope Bonifice VIII was a
  controversial fourteenth century pope.  When Philip IV intended to
  tax the clergy, Bonifice responded that clergy could not pay taxes
  in any state without papal consent.   The power struggle underscored
  the inherent tension between the powerful European monarchs and the
  supreme papal authority.  Bonifice wrote a series of   letters \ to
  solidify his argument.  One of them was the   Unam Sanctam , see
  below, which he wrote in   1302.
  Bonifice intended to
  excommunicate Phillip, however Philip conspired to have the pope
  brought on charges of heresy.  Eventually the pope was captured,
  freed again, and then killed by conspirators who were incited to the
  action by Philip.
