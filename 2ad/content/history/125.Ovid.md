## _person_  Ovid-
  43 BCE-
18 CE
-
Ovid is said to be the last of
the great poets of the Roman   golden age. \ Ovid's work takes a
carefree approach to traditional Roman values, and often lampooned
them.  His famous works include   Amores, \ a series of love
poems,   Metamorphoses, \ and   The Art of Love, \ a work
which diagrams methods for the seduction of women.   While Augustus
attempted to eschew the loose sexual morals of the then Roman
upper-class, Ovid is said to, perhaps mockingly, affirm them.
