## _history_  weregeld-
Literally, "money for a man."  In Germanic
law most crimes were treated personally, with punishment meted out
directly by a person's family.   The system of   weregeld \
payments was orchestrated as a reaction to the heavy toll that was
sometimes extracted by grieving family members who wished to receive
retribution for their lost relative.     Weregeld \ amounted to a
fine where the guilty party would pay a fixed sum in retribution to
the family of the victim.
