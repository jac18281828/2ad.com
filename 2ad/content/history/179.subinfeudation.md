Subinfeudation is the term for the
hierarchical structure that existed between Lords and their Vassals in
the middle ages. At the top of the structure there were kings. The
kings in turn had Vassals who were powerful Lords or Barons. These
powerful Lords were also major land owners, who in turn had Vassals who
may have been lesser land owners, but still powerful, each Lord in
turn has it's own Vassals terminating with the lowest level
subordinate knights or minor land owners. This hierarchy was not a
formal system of government, but the natural extension of feudal
practice in the middle ages.
