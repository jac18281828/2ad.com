Augustus was a special title
awarded to Octavian, Caesar's heir, adopted son, and grandnephew.
Augustus signified "the revered one." Augustus
ruled Rome in concert with Caesar's close ally, Mark Antony. The
regime is known to have meted out revenge against Caesar's assassins,
including Cicero. The political alliance between Antony, Augustus,
and Marcus Lepidus is known to historians as the "Second
Triumvirate," and was recognized in Roman law with legal authority to
rule. Nonetheless, cooperation wouldn't last long, since Antony and
Octavian would later struggle for ultimate rule of the Roman world,
see Battle of Actium. After the power struggle at Actium, Octavian
was left as the exclusive ruler over a Roman empire, and as much
as any other event this signified the end of the Roman republic.
