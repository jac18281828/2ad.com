## _person_ Theocritus-
 315 - 250 BCE
-
Theocritus was a native of
Sicily who wrote short poems known as idylls. The themes of
Theocritus' poetry usually centered around eroticism, "lovers'
complaints," and nature. Theocritus' contemporaries believed that
Homer's epic's could never be out done and thus writers should
limit the length of their work to short poems.
