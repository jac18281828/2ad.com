## _history_  "Peasant's Crusade"-
After Pope Urban II called the people
  to arms against Infidels, Peter the Hermit, a man who had holy
  visions, incited a large mob to take up a crusade in eastern Europe.
  The mob was made up largely of the poor and thus was referred to as a
  "Peasant's Crusade."
