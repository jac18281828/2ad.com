The son of
Amenhotep the III. Amenhotep IV was preoccupied with the worship of
Aton, god of the sun disk. Amenhotep changed his name to
Akhenaton, which means "It is well with Aton" and closed temples
of other gods, including Atum-Re. Atum-Re was popular in Thebes, so
Amenhotep IV moved the capital of Egypt 200 miles North to a new city
known as Akhenaton or 'dedicated to Aton.'
