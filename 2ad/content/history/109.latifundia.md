## _history_  latifundia-
The   latifundia \ were enormous farms
administered by wealthy landed aristocrats.  The   latifundia \
were known for their wide use of slaves.  The   latifundia \
resulted in agricultural intensification as the wealthy landowners
bought poor peasant farms.  The   latifundia \ primarily
produced olives, wine, and sheep.   Since Rome primarily conscripted
military service from landowners, the   latifundia \ resulted in a
diminished number of citizens available for military service.  The
latifundia \ also served to spawn a new class of landless poor in Rome.
