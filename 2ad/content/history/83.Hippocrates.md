Hippocrates was a philosopher
who lived in the time of Socrates. His contribution to medical
science is notable, since he is regarded to have been the first
philosopher to acknowledge a distinction between medicine and
philosophy. Hippocrates focused on natural explanations and cures
for disease rather than philosophical ones.
