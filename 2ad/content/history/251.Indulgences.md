## _history_  Indulgences-
Indulgences were a common practice of Catholic
  church from before the middle ages through the sixteenth century.
  In particular, Pope Leo X granted a special jubilee indulgence to
  finance Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome.  However, religious
  reformers such as Martin Luther openly criticized the practice of
  paying for penance.  Indulgences became a motivational force for
  religious reform, as they tended to underscore hypocrisy in the
  Catholic church.
