## _history_  Antigonid Dynasty-
After a long period of internal power
struggles the empire built by Alexander was dismantled.  In    276
BCE
 a grandson of one of Alexander's generals, Antigonus~Gonatus,
established a new dynasty in Macedonia known as the Antigonid Dynasty.
The Antigonid Dynasty is marked by it's tenuous relations with the
Greeks.   The Antigonid's regarded control of Greece to be a
required element of their power, while the Greeks regarded the
Antigonids as important to control the Northern Borders and prevent
the influx of Gallic and Thracian invaders.  Nonetheless, each party
was fearful of the other's power and influence.
