## _person_ Ashurbanipal-
669 - 626 BCE-
Ashurbanipal was one of the most
notable kings of Assyria. He was ruler when the Babylonians
revolted against Assyrian rule. As Ashurbanipal focused on the
Babylonian conflict, Egypt was able to free itself from Assyrian
rule. Thus the Assyrian empire disintegrated just after the reign of
Ashurbanipal.
