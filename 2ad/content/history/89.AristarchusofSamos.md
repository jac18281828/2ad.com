A Greek astronomer
who is known to have developed a heliocentric view of the universe.
Aristarchus of Samos believed that the Sun and stars were 'fixed' in
the heavens, while the Earth rotated around the Sun in a circular
orbit. Aristarchus also believed that the Earth revolved around its
own axis. At this time the heliocentric view of the Earth was not
well regarded, as most believed the Earth was at the center of the Sun
and stars.
