The Epic of Gilgamesh
is a poem dating to ancient Sumeria.  It recounts the tale of
Gilgamesh.  Gilgamesh describes a cataclysmic flood sent down upon the
Earth by the gods to destroy human kind.  A god, Ea, revealed the plot
to destroy humanity to a man, Utnapishtim.  Utnapishtim built a boat
which was said to bear the "seed of all living creatures."  The epic
of Gilgamesh is thought to be the progenitor of the Biblical tale of
Noah and the Great Flood.
