Herodotus wrote what is
often considered one of the first histories written in Western
Civilization, History of the Persian Wars. He is often
referred to as the "father of history" since his work is the earliest
lengthly text to survive intact. Herodotus' central theme deals with
the struggle between the Greeks and Persians. However, Herodotus'
work also covers numerous other cultures and civilizations,
demonstrating a great breadth and depth of interest in numerous subjects.
