## _people_  Hyksos-
Upper Egypt and Arabian Desert-
The Hyksos migrated
into the delta region of the upper Nile,   1652 - 1557 BCE. This
migration initiated a second age of chaos in Egypt, since the Hyksos
perpetrated frequent attacks and raids upon Egyptian cities. The
Hyksos spoke Semitic languages and originated on the Arabian
peninsula.  The Hyksos introduced the Egyptians to Bronze Age
technology.   The Hyksos also taught the Egyptians modern techniques
of agriculture and warfare, including the horse-drawn chariot, heavier
swords and compound bows.
