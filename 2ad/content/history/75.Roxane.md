## _person_  Roxane-
  350 BCE
-
Roxane was the daughter of a Bactrian
Baron named Oxyartes.  Alexander the Great married Roxane,   327
BCE,
 as was common practice, to cement relations between his empire
and Roxane's state, which he had defeated.  Alexander died when Roxane
was pregnant with his only heir.  Later, Roxane gave birth, however
the boy was unable to become ruler of Alexander's empire because both
Roxane and the heir were killed for political reasons.
