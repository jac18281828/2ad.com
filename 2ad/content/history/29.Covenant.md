## _history_ Covenant-
 1000 BCE
 -- Moses, a renowned leader of
the Hebrew people, received the "Covenant" from God on Mt. Sinai.
The covenant includes the Ten Commandments, which were embossed on
stone tablets. Saul, the first king of the Hebrew people established
a kingdom near Palestine. Later, David and Solomon expanded the
kingdom of Israel, and established Jerusalem as a center of Hebrew
Worship. The Hebrew people were forced out of Jerusalem and
into slavery by the Neo-Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar
 II, 600
BCE. It is during this time that the Hebrew people wrote down their
religious law and practice, and began to focus their religion on the
written word of God.
