## _history_  Persian Wars-
  550-
469 BCE
 -- A series of battles
and uprisings stemming from Persian encroachment into Greek
territories.   The Persians conquered the Ionian Greek cities prior to
  550 BCE,
 however, the Persian rule was seen as needlessly
harsh and cruel by the Greeks.  The Greeks revolted in   499 BCE

and this lead to a series of battles that was not resolved with
finality until   469 BCE,
 when the Greeks formed the   Delian
League
 and the largest Greek army ever.   They were then
able to defeat the Persian army and navy.  One of the most important
battles of this period was, Marathon,   490 BCE,
 where the
Athenians and Plataeans defeated the Persians, lead by Darius who was
attempting to expand the Persian empire onto mainland Greece.
