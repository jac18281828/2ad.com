The Flavian Dynasty includes
the Roman rulers Vespasian,   69-
79 CE
, Titus,
  79-
81 CE
, Domitian,   81-
96 CE.  The time of the
Flavian Dynasty was one of the first eras where Roman rulers referred
to themselves as Emperors, thus signifying a final transition from
republican ideals to monarchic rule.  After the year of four emperors,
  69 CE
, Vespasian rose to power as a result of his command of
the legions of the east.   This shows the influence of the military in
Roman politics at this time, for the most part, those who commanded
large legions also could take control of the state.  Further
undermining the old republican ethics, Vespasian established dynastic
succession, and his sons Titus and Domitian followed him.  However,
the Flavian dynasty wouldn't last long, since Domitian was assassinated
in    96 CE.
