## _movement_  Counter-Reformation-
1555-
Though many reforms had occurred
  in the Catholic church there were those who tried to impose a
  structure based on past ideals.  Pope Paul IV,   1555-
1559

  was considered to be a counter-reformation pope because of his
  traditional interpretations of religious doctrine.  Paul IV created
  the   Papal Index
 and also vastly increased the power of
  the Inquisition, a move which threatened even the most powerful
  dissenters with torture or death.   Though, Christian unity was a
  goal for some, the counter-reformation and the Council of Trent
  served to permanently solidify the divisions that had formed in the
  church.
