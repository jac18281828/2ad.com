## _people_  Etruscans-
Central Italian Peninsula, modern day
Tuscany-
  900-
450 BCE
 -- The Etruscans had a major influence
on the Roman civilization.  The origin of the Etruscans is subject to
debate, some historians believe the Etruscans are Italian natives,
while others believe they migrated from Asia-Minor, or elsewhere.
The Etruscans lived in walled cities established north of the
city of Rome.  The Etruscans also showed some Greek influence, and it
is known that the Etruscans adopted an alphabet from the Greeks
before   600 BCE.
  The Etruscans expanded in Italy and became the
dominant culture and economy on the peninsula after   650 BCE.

However, their influence was waning by   400 BCE,
 when
invasions from the Gauls and Romans curbed their power.
Subsequently, the Etruscans were conquered by the Romans.  Nonetheless,
the Roman culture borrowed heavily from the Etruscans.
