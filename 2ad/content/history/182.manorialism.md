## _history_  manorialism-
Manorialism extended the concept of feudal
fiefdom's as a principal land owner, or Lord, was the overseer and
master of a Manor.  The Manor was the principal dwelling on the Lord's
property or estate.   The Lord had servants on the Manor known as
serfs.  The Lord was allowed to retain a modicum of governmental power
in his Manor including the maintenance of a court and the enforcement
of monopolistic power over the production of the serfs.  The Manor was
like a state within a state, and the lives of the serfs were dominated
and controlled principally by the Lord's will alone.
