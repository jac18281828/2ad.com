Scandinavia-
The Vikings are a Germanic people who
settled in Scandinavia. These tribal warriors were also known as the
Norsemen. The Vikings excelled as warriors, ship builders, and
sailors. The combination of these skills allowed the Vikings to come
into contact with much of the known world at the time. The Vikings
sporadically raided cities throughout Europe. The Vikings
competency at sea allowed them to reach far out into new territories,
however they lacked political sophistication, will, and organization
so their overall influence was minimized to that of raiders.
