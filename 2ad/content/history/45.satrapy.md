## _history_  satrapy-
A unit of Persian governance similar to a province.
The Persian empire consisted of more than twenty of these provinces
which were arranged by geography and ethnicity.   Each satrapy was
ruled by a Satrap or Governor.  The satrapies were under the rule of
the Great King of Persia, but had a fair amount of autonomy as
compared with other empires.   The flexibility in the Persian system
of government is one of the reasons for it's long term success.
