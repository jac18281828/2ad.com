A hill people of Central Italy, who, from

290 BCE,
 waged war with the Romans.  Finally, Rome
defeated them and established a treaty with the Samnite states
providing an expanded Roman Confederation and an alliance between
the parties.  In return, the Samnites provided Rome with military aid,

laws, and government.  The Roman conquest of the Samnites expanded
Roman power and influence across much of Italy.
