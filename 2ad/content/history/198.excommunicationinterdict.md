## _history_  excommunication/interdict-

  Excommunication is the formal process of banning someone from attending
  church.  Excommunication was seen as one of the severest penalties
  in the middle ages.  Persons could be excommunicated for committing
  any of a number of sins, after which, a church official would
  formally forbid them from returning to the church.   Interdict
  was a form of punishment for a people or nation.  The people subject
  to interdict could not partake in several important sacraments.
  In accord with the common belief system, this would hold serious
  consequences in the afterlife.
