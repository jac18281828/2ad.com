The Magna Carta was a great charter
 of feudal liberties. The Magna Carta was supported by the English
 nobility because it limited the power of the English monarchy. Much
 of the Magna Carta was aimed at preventing wrongful imprisonment,
 and to prevent the king from conducting executions or taking land,
 without sufficient reason. Some of these precepts survive to this day in
 modern constitutional law, including Amendment~4 in the
 United~States Constitution.
