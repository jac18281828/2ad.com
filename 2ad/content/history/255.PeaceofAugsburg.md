## _event_  Peace of Augsburg-
1555-
The Protestant Reformation
  instigated a spate of religious turmoil and warfare throughout
  Europe, since few states and officials could agree on the fate of
  the two intertwined yet conflicting ecclesiastical disciplines.  Wars
  between Italy, Spain, Germany and the Turks marked the period until
  the Peace of Augsburg.   The Peace of Augsburg granted Lutherans the
  same legal rights as Catholics and settled the disputes between the
  Lutheran Germans and other non-Lutherans.  The Peace of Augsburg also
  cemented the independence of the German Princes who had eschewed the
  will of the Holy Roman Emperor and triumphed.
