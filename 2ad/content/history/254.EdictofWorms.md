In response to Martin Luther's
 strong condemnation of church doctrine, Holy Roman Emperor
 Charles~V, 1519-
1556
 convened a meeting to force Luther to
 recant his heretical stance. Undaunted, Luther stood fast, and
 proclaimed that [paraphrase] he had arrived at his beliefs based on
 the word of God, and only the word of God would dissuade him. The
 Emperor, not being one to withstand such a rebuff, quickly issued the
 Edict of Worms, making Luther an outlaw and required Luther to be
 captured and his works to be burned.
